        alert ("An interesting calculation:");

        let amt; 

        let pP = 101.5; // the price of the product, productPrice
        let pQ = 50;  // number of items in stock, productQuantity

        let productQuantity = Number(prompt("How much do you want to buy?"));
           
        amt = pP * productQuantity; // calculation of the cost of the selected number of goods, Лђла - the specified price, productQuantity - the amount that the user contributes
    
        alert(`For the specified number of goods at a price ${pP} have to pay ${amt}`);

        alert(`After purchase there will be such quantity in stock: ${pQ - productQuantity}`);
        // alert(`After purchase there will be such quantity in stock: ${(pQ - productQuantity)}`); - brackets inside for complex calculations, they are not displayed in the message

        
       //one more solution:
       // let count = prompt("How many items do you want to purchase?", 1);
       // let totalSum = count * productPrice;
       // let leftInStorage = productQuantity - count; 
       // alert("Total cost " + totalSum);
       // alert("Quantity of goods that will remain in stock after purchase " + leftInStorage);
